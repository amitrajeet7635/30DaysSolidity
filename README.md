# 30DaysSolidity

Welcome to my **30DaysSolidity** challenge!
I'm participating in this journey with [Web3Compass](https://www.web3compass.xyz/) to strengthen my skills in Solidity and smart contract development.

While it's called *30DaysSolidity*, Iâ€™ll be completing **2â€“3 challenges per day**, so the entire journey may take **less than 30 days** to complete.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find:

* Daily submissions of Solidity challenges.
* A dedicated folder for each challenge.
* A README file for each challenge explaining:

  * The problem statement.
  * My thought process and solution approach.
  * Key learnings from the challenge.

This repo is a personal log of my Web3 learning journey â€” from writing basic contracts to tackling more complex use cases on-chain. However, I would really appreciate it if you feel that the code written can be more gas-optimized in a better way; then please do so, that would be greatly appreciated.

Letâ€™s BUIDL! ðŸš€
