# Problem Statement:
### Create a solidity program where user can save there name and bio and then can retrive them as well.

# My Approach:
### I used setter and getter function to set the name and bio and to retrieve the data back by calling the functions. In this we can skip the getter function because initailly in the string no data is present so those variables itself work as a getter function and we can directly get the saved data by just calling that variable.
