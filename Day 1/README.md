# Problem Statement
## In this problem we need to create a simple Click Counter that will count the number of total count of a counter.It is similar like a digital counter which count a click everytime a function is called.

# My Approach:
## To solve this problem, the basic approach was to create a function named click(), and a uint256 variable that will store the count, in the function the variable is being incremented everyting the function is called. We are using increment operator to increase the count.
