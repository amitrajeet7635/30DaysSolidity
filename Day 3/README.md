# Problem Statement:
### To create a simple voting system, where the candidate can be added and then you can get the details of the candidates.

# My Approach:
### I used simple string array to save the names of the candidates and then to cast vote we used mapping to map each candidate ID to it's vote count. Also I used a helper function that verifies that you cannot vote a candidate that is not added to the candidate list.
