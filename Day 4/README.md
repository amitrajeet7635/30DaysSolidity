# Problem Statement: 
To create a simple bidding system, using block.timestamp and if/else statement. In this problem we need to set the highest bid amount and the highest bidder. 

# My Approach:
I used address type to get the bidder address, and used timestamp to set the auction time, also I used revert with if/else to immediately revert the transaction, if the condition is not met.
