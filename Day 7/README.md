# Problem Statement:
We need to create a IOU where we can maintain a ledger. This is a kind of splitwise but on steriods (just kidding). It's a simple web3 splitwise where we have a group of friends and we maintian a record that who owns who and how much, and pay the debts.

# My Approach:
To solve this issue I mainly used some new concepts like nested paying to identify which address own how much to other address. Also I used transfer() and call() method to transfer the direct eth to the others wallet. Other than that I applied the eariler concepts like constructor, modifier, payable as we need to transfer real eth. Rest you can check the above code and optimise the code. That would be really aprreciated.
